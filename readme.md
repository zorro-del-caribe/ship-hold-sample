This is a almost real world application (a blog) built using [ship-hold](https://zorro-del-caribe/ship-hold).

1. Clone this repository and ``npm install``
2. Start a Postgres sql database somewhere
3. modify the [config file]() accordingly to your set up
4. create fixture by running ``npm run db:bootstrap`` (takes sometimes)
5. start the app ``npm start`` and go to http://localhost:3000

You should have a blog with 200 posts, some comments, some users, some tags.

If you need to login

username: "admin1" (or 2,3,4,5)
password: "admin"

A go through video will come soon ...
